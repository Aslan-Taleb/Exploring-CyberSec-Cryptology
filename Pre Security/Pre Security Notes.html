Pre Security Notes
    Network Fundamentals
        Indentifying Devices on a Network
            IP Addresses (Internet Protocol)
                there are two type public and private
                A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices.
                it's 4 octet (so 8bits * 4) (0-255)Internet Protocol addressing:
                    IPV4 support 2^32 IP adresses
                    IPV6 2^128
                Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways:
                    Identify the network address
                    Identify the host address
                    Identify the default gateway
            MAC Addresses(Media Access Control)
                physical network interface(which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard)
                it can be "spoofed":
                    pretends to identify as another using its MAC address
                 twelve-character hexadecimal number:
                    split into two's and separated by a colon. These colons are considered separators. For example, __a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d__. The first six characters represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.
        Ping(ICMP)
            fundamental network tools available
            
            Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices
            commande : ping IP address or website URL
        Local Area Network (LAN) 
            different type of topology
                Bus,Ring,Star
            Switch
                designed to aggregate multiple devices
                keep track of what device is connected to which port
                 can connect a large number of devices by having ports of 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 64 for devices to plug into.
            Router
                connect networks and pass data between them
        Subnetting
            splitting up a network into smaller
            benefits:
                Efficiency
                Security
                Full control
            it's represented by a number called a subnet mask
        ARP Protocol (Address Resolution Protocol)
            responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network.
            allows a device to associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network. Each device on a network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices.
            When devices wish to communicate with another, they will send a broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device. Devices can use the ARP protocol to find the MAC address (and therefore the physical identifier) of a device for communication.
            In order to map these two identifiers together (IP address and MAC address), the ARP protocol sends two types of messages
                ARP Request
                ARP Reply
            When an ARP request is sent, a message is broadcasted to every other device found on a network by the device, asking whether or not the device's MAC address matches the requested IP address. If the device does have the requested IP address, an ARP reply is returned to the initial device to acknowledge this. The initial device will now remember this and store it within its cache
        DHCP Protocol (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
            When a device connects to a network, if it has not already been manually assigned an IP address, it sends out a request (DHCP Discover) to see if any DHCP servers are on the network. The DHCP server then replies back with an IP address the device could use (DHCP Offer). The device then sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP Address (DHCP Request), and then lastly, the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging this has been completed, and the device can start using the IP Address (DHCP ACK).
        OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)
            Application
                how the user should interact with data sent or received.(the interface)
            Presentation
                standardisation
                    This layer acts as a translator for data to and from the application layer (layer 7). The receiving computer will also understand data sent to a computer in one format destined for in another format.(
            Session
                synchronises the two computers to ensure that they are on the same page before data is sent and received
            Transport
                 vital part in transmitting data across a network
                    use two protocol TCP and UDP
                        TCP(The Transmission Control Protocol) 
                            This protocol reserves a constant connection between the two devices 
                            incorporates error checking
                            guarantee that data sent from the small chunks in the session layer
                            used for situations such as file sharing, internet browsing or sending an email
                        UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
                            no synchronisation between the two devices or guarantee
                            useful in situations where there are small pieces of data being sent 
                                for example ARP AND DHCP
                            useful where it is okay if some part miss (video streaming)
            Network
                routing
                    determines the most optimal path in which these chunks of data should be sent
                    OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and RIP (Routing Information Protocol). 
                        The factors that decide what route is taken is path is the shortest most reliable faster physical connection
                everything is dealt with via IP addresses
                 Devices such as routers capable of delivering packets using IP addresses are known as Layer 3 devices — because they are capable of working at the third layer of the OSI model.
            Data link
                focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission
                It receives a packet from the network layer (including the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical MAC (Media Access Control) address of the receiving endpoint.
                
            Physical
                physical components of the hardware used in networking and is the lowest layer that you will find. Devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other in a binary numbering system (1's and 0's).
        Packets and Frames
            small pieces of data that, when forming together, make a larger piece of information or message.
            Frame
                A frame is at layer 2(data link) so no IP addresses
            Packets
                when we are talking about anything IP addresses, we are talking about packets
                Packets are an efficient way of communicating data across networked
                Packets have different structures that are dependant upon the type of packet that is being sent
                A packet using this protocol will have a set of headers that contain additional pieces of information to the data that is being sent across a network.
                    Time to Live,Source Address,Destination Address
            TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol)
                 TCP must establish a connection between both a client and a device acting as a server before data is sent.
                guarantees that any data sent will be received on the other end
                This process is named the Three-way handshake
                    SYN,SYN/ACK,ACK
        Ports
            essential point in which data can be exchanged
            Port Forwarding
                
        Firewall
            determining what traffic is allowed to enter and exit
            administrator can configure a firewall to permit or deny traffic based on factors
                Where the traffic is coming from
                Where is the traffic going to
                What protocol is the traffic using
            Firewalls perform packet inspection to determine the answers
        VPN(Virtual Private Network)
    How The Web Works
        DNS(Domain Name System)
            a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers
            What happens when you make a DNS request
                your computer first checks its local cache to see if you've previously looked up the address recently
                A Recursive DNS Server is called(This server also has a local cache of recently looked up domain names.)
                    If a result is found locally, this is sent back to your computer
                 If the request cannot be found locally, a journey begins to find the correct answer, starting with the internet's root DNS servers.
            instead of remembering 104.26.10.229, you can remember tryhackme.com instead.
        HTTP
            (rules used for communicating with web servers for the transmitting of webpage data, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc.)
            HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. HTTPS data is encrypted so it not only stops people from seeing the data you are receiving and sending, but it also gives you assurances that you're talking to the correct web server and not something impersonating it.
            Methods
                GET Request
                POST Request
                PUT Request
                DELETE Request
            Status Code
                100-199 - Information Response
                200-299 - Success
                300-399 - Redirection
                400-499 - Client Errors
                500-599 - Server Errors
        URL(Uniform Resource Locator)
            instruction on how to access a resource on the internet
            Structure of an URL
                Scheme
                    This instructs on what protocol to use for accessing the resource such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
                User
                    Some services require authentication to log in, you can put a username and password into the URL to log in.
                Host
                    The domain name or IP address of the server you wish to access.
                Port
                     The Port that you are going to connect to, usually 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS, but this can be hosted on any port between 1 - 65535.
                Path
                    The file name or location of the resource you are trying to access.
                Query String
                    Extra bits of information that can be sent to the requested path. For example, /blog?id=1 would tell the blog path that you wish to receive the blog article with the id of 1.
                Fragment
                    Extra bits of information that can be sent to the requested path. For example, /blog?id=1 would tell the blog path that you wish to receive the blog article with the id of 1.
        Making a Request
            It's possible to make a request to a web server with just one line "GET / HTTP/1.1",But for a much richer web experience, you’ll need to send other data as well. This other data is sent in what is called headers.
            Example : 
                 GET / HTTP/1.1
                    This request is sending the GET method ( more on this in the HTTP Methods task ), request the home page with / and telling the web server we are using HTTP protocol version 1.1.
                Host: tryhackme.com
                    We tell the web server we want the website tryhackme.com
                User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
                    We tell the web server we are using the Firefox version 87 Browser
                Referer: https://tryhackme.com/
                    We are telling the web server that the web page that referred us to this one is [https://tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com/)
        Cookies
            small piece of data that is stored on your computer. Cookies are saved when you receive a "Set-Cookie" header from a web server. Then every further request you make, you'll send the cookie data back to the web server. Because HTTP is stateless (doesn't keep track of your previous requests), cookies can be used to remind the web server who you are, some personal settings for the website or whether you've been to the website before
            Cookies can be used for many purposes but are most commonly used for website authentication
    Linux Fundamentals
        SSH(Secure Shell)
            ssh tryhackme@MACHINE_IP
            protocol between devices in an encrypted form
             remotely execute commands on another device remotely
            ny data sent between the devices is encrypted when it is sent over a network
        su (to switch user)
            su user2
        wget (to download files)
            wget https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/linux-fundamentals/part3/myfile.txt
        SCP(Secure copy)
            allows you to
                Copy files & directories from your current system to a remote system
                Copy files & directories from a remote system to your current system
            the format of SCP is just SOURCE and DESTINATION
                scp important.txt ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt
                scp ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/documents.txt notes.txt 
        Serving Files From Your Host - WEB
            we can start a server
                python3 -m  http.server
            using wget we can get the file we want
                wget http://127.0.0.1:8000/file
        Processes
            provide a list of the running processes 
                ps
            we can see processes run by other users and those that don't run from a session
                ps aux
            real-time statistics about the processes running on your system instead of a one-time view
                top
            Managing Processes
                we can kill a process
                    kill 1337
                we can do many things to a process
                    systemctl start apache2
                    we can replace start by
                        Start
                        Stop
                        Enable
                        Disable
            Backgrounding and Foregrounding
                using "&" we can make a process on the background or we can use "Ctrl + Z"
                    great for commands such as copying files because it means that we can run the command in the background and continue on with whatever further commands we wish to execute
                we can bring to foreground by using "fg"
        Automation
            using cron process
                A crontab is simply a special file with formatting that is recognised by the cron process to execute each line step-by-step.
                responsible for facilitating and managing cron jobs
                more specifcly crontabs
        Logs
            Located in the /var/log directory, these files and folders contain logging information for applications and services running on your system
            a great way in monitoring the health of your system and protecting it
    Windows Fundamentals
        The File System
            the New Technology File System or simply [NTFS]
                NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file.
                 you can set permissions .
                    The permissions are:
                        Full control
                        Modify
                        Read & Execute
                        List folder contents
                        Read
                        Write
            Before NTFS, there was FAT16/FAT32
                still see FAT partitions in use today. For example, you typically see FAT partitions in USB devices, MicroSD cards
            System32 folder
                holds the important files that are critical for the operating system
                Accidentally deleting any files or folders within System32 can render the Windows OS inoperational
        Local User and Group Management
            on run type "lusrmgr.msc" to get it
        User Account Control
            When a user with an account type of administrator logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with elevated permissions. When an operation requiring higher-level privileges needs to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the operation to run.
        Computer Management
            "compmgmt.msc" on run to get it
            Event Viewer
                view events that have occurred on the computer. These records of events can be seen as an audit trail that can be used to understand the activity of the computer system. This information is often used to diagnose problems and investigate actions executed on the system. 
            Shared Folders
                
        System Configuartion
            this tool gathers information about your computer and displays a comprehensive view of your hardware, system components, and software environment, which you can use to diagnose computer issues.
