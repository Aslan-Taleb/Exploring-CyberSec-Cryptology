Intro To Cyber Security Notes
    Intro to Offensive Security
        First hack
            we use the command gobuster
                gobuster -u http://fakebank.com -w wordlist.txt dir
                    -u is used to state the website we're scanning, -w takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages.
                    wordlist.txt is a text file that contains names of potentially hidden pages
            so we find "/bank-transfer"

                Design, monitor, and maintain security controls, networks, and systems to help prevent cyberattacks.
    Intro to Defensive Security
        Preventing intrusions from occurring
        Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
        Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.
        Tasks
            User cyber security awareness
            Documenting and managing assets
            Updating and patching systems
            Setting up preventative security devices
                 firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
            Setting up logging and monitoring devices
                If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to know.
        Areas
            Security Operations Center (SOC)
                 team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events
                main areas of interest
                    Vulnerabilities
                    Policy violations
                    Network intrusions
                    Unauthorized activity
            Threat Intelligence
                aims to gather information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries
                Intelligence needs data. Data has to be collected, processed, and analyzed.
                Learning about your adversaries allows you to know their tactics, techniques, and procedures. As a result of threat intelligence, we identify the threat actor (adversary), predict their activity, and consequently, we will be able to mitigate their attacks and prepare a response strategy.
            Digital Forensics
                the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts.

        Red Teamer
        Penetration Tester 
        Malware Analyst
    Web Application Security
        a few formal categories from OWASP
            Identification and Authentication Failure
                Allowing the attacker to use brute force
                Allowing the user to choose a weak password
                Storing the users’ passwords in plain text
            Broken Access Control
                ensures that each user can only access files (documents, images, etc.) related to their role or work.
            Injection
                 insert malicious code as part of their input
            Cryptographic Failures
                Sending sensitive data in clear text
                Relying on a weak cryptographic algorithm
                Using default or weak keys for cryptographic functions
    Operating System Security
        When we talk about security, we should think of protecting three things
            Confidentiality
            Integrity
            Availability
        weaknesses targeted by malicious users
            Authentication and Weak Passwords
            Weak File Permissions
            Access to Malicious Programs
            
        Some Practical
            The accounts root and administrator have complete unrestricted access to a system.
            we can use ssh USERNAME@MACHINE_IP to connect on another device
            whoami to know who is the current user
            history this command prints the commands used by the user.
            su - root to switch to the root account
    Network Security
        Network security consists of different hardware and software solutions to achieve the set security goals
        Examples of hardware appliances
            Firewall appliance
                The firewall allows and blocks connections based on a predefined set of rules. It restricts what can enter and what can leave a network.
            Intrusion Detection System (IDS) appliance
                An IDS detects system and network intrusions and intrusion attempts. It tries to detect attackers’ attempts to break into your network.
            intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
                An IPS blocks detected intrusions and intrusion attempts. It aims to prevent attackers from breaking into your network.
            Virtual Private Network (VPN)
         software security solutions.
            Antivirus software
            Host firewall
        Attack Network Methodology
            Recon
            Weaponization
            Delivery
            Exploitation
            Installation
            Command & Control 
            Actions on Objectives
        PRACTICAL
            We used nmap to learn about the running services.
                FTP (File Transfer Protocol) wich sometimes we can connect as anonymous
                    if it's work we can you get filename to dwnld files we want
                    then we use exit or bye to quit
            We connected to the FTP server to learn more about its configuration.
            We discovered a file containing the root password mistakenly copied to a public folder.
            We used the password we found, allowing us to log in successfully.
            We gained access to all the users’ files.
    Intro to Digital Forensics
         the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts.
            Public-sector investigations refer to the investigations carried out by government and law enforcement agencies.
            Private-sector investigations refer to the investigations carried out by corporate bodies by assigning a private investigator
        Digital Forensics Process
            Acquire the evidence
            Establish a chain of custody
            Place the evidence in a secure container
        Practical
