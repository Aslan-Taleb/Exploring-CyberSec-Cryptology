Each device on a network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices.</li><li>When devices wish to communicate with another, they will send a broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device. Devices can use the ARP protocol to find the MAC address (and therefore the physical identifier) of a device for communication.</li><li>In order to map these two identifiers together (IP address and MAC address), the ARP protocol sends two types of messages<ul><li>ARP Request</li><li>ARP Reply</li></ul></li><li>When an ARP request is sent, a message is broadcasted to every other device found on a network by the device, asking whether or not the device's MAC address matches the requested IP address. If the device does have the requested IP address, an ARP reply is returned to the initial device to acknowledge this. The initial device will now remember this and store it within its cache</li></ul></li><li>DHCP Protocol (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)<ul><li>When a device connects to a network, if it has not already been manually assigned an IP address, it sends out a request (DHCP Discover) to see if any DHCP servers are on the network. The DHCP server then replies back with an IP address the device could use (DHCP Offer). The device then sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP Address (DHCP Request), and then lastly, the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging this has been completed, and the device can start using the IP Address (DHCP ACK).</li></ul></li><li>OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)<ul><li>Application<ul><li>how the user should interact with data sent or received.(the interface)</li></ul></li><li>Presentation<ul><li>standardisation<ul><li>This layer acts as a translator for data to and from the application layer (layer 7).

This other data is sent in what is called headers.</li><li>Example : <ul><li> GET / HTTP/1.1<ul><li>This request is sending the GET method ( more on this in the HTTP Methods task ), request the home page with / and telling the web server we are using HTTP protocol version 1.1.</li></ul></li><li>Host: tryhackme.com<ul><li>We tell the web server we want the website tryhackme.com</li></ul></li><li>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0<ul><li>We tell the web server we are using the Firefox version 87 Browser</li></ul></li><li>Referer: https://tryhackme.com/<ul><li>We are telling the web server that the web page that referred us to this one is <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">https://tryhackme.com</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Cookies<ul><li>small piece of data that is stored on your computer. Cookies are saved when you receive a "Set-Cookie" header from a web server. Then every further request you make, you'll send the cookie data back to the web server. Because HTTP is stateless (doesn't keep track of your previous requests), cookies can be used to remind the web server who you are, some personal settings for the website or whether you've been to the website before</li><li>Cookies can be used for many purposes but are most commonly used for website authentication</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Linux Fundamentals<ul><li>SSH(Secure Shell)<ul><li>ssh tryhackme@MACHINE_IP</li><li>protocol between devices in an encrypted form</li><li> remotely execute commands on another device remotely</li><li>ny data sent between the devices is encrypted when it is sent over a network</li></ul></li><li>su (to switch user)<ul><li>su user2</li></ul></li><li>wget (to download files)<ul><li>wget https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/linux-fundamentals/part3/myfile.txt</li></ul></li><li>SCP(Secure copy)<ul><li>allows you to<ul><li>Copy files &amp; directories from your current system to a remote system</li><li>Copy files &amp; directories from a remote system to your current system</li></ul></li><li>the format of SCP is just SOURCE and DESTINATION<ul><li>scp important.txt ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt</li><li>scp ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/documents.txt notes.txt </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Serving Files From Your Host - WEB<ul><li>we can start a server<ul><li>python3 -m  http.server</li></ul></li><li>using wget we can get the file we want<ul><li>wget http://127.0.0.1:8000/file</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Processes<ul><li>provide a list of the running processes <ul><li>ps</li></ul></li><li>we can see processes run by other users and those that don't run from a session<ul><li>ps aux</li></ul></li><li>real-time statistics about the processes running on your system instead of a one-time view<ul><li>top</li></ul></li><li>Managing Processes<ul><li>we can kill a process<ul><li>kill 1337</li></ul></li><li>we can do many things to a process<ul><li>systemctl start apache2</li><li>we can replace start by<ul><li>Start</li><li>Stop</li><li>Enable</li><li>Disable</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Backgrounding and Foregrounding<ul><li>using "&amp;" we can make a process on the background or we can use "Ctrl + Z"<ul><li>great for commands such as copying files because it means that we can run the command in the background and continue on with whatever further commands we wish to execute</li></ul></li><li>we can bring to foreground by using "fg"</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Automation<ul><li>using cron process<ul><li>A crontab is simply a special file with formatting that is recognised by the cron process to execute each line step-by-step.</li><li>responsible for facilitating and managing cron jobs</li><li>more specifcly crontabs</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Logs<ul><li>Located in the /var/log directory, these files and folders contain logging information for applications and services running on your system</li><li>a great way in monitoring the health of your system and protecting it</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Windows Fundamentals<ul><li>The File System<ul><li>the New Technology File System or simply [NTFS]<ul><li>NTFS is known as a journaling file system.
