<h1 align="center">Learning Hacking & Cryptologie 🐱‍💻 
</h1>
</p>

Welcome to the Explore-Hack-Crypto repository! This repository will serve as my learning playground as I embark on my journey into the fascinating fields of hacking and cryptography. Over the next one or two months, I'll be starting my Master's program in Cryptology and Cyber Security at Cryptis, Limoges. This repository will be my hub for exploring the realms of hacking and cryptography.

# Purpose : 

The primary purpose of this repository is to document and share my progress as I delve into the domains of hacking and cryptography. I will be using two platforms, TryHackMe and CryptoHack, to enhance my knowledge and skills in these areas. Here's what you can expect to find in this repository:

Python Scripts: I will publish the Python scripts I create while solving challenges on TryHackMe and CryptoHack. These scripts will demonstrate my problem-solving skills and understanding of cryptographic algorithms.

Revision Material: This repository will act as a revision resource for me. I'll organize the challenges, solutions, and cryptographic concepts in a way that will help me review and reinforce my understanding.

Badges and Certifications: Whenever I earn badges or certifications from TryHackMe or CryptoHack, I'll proudly display them here. These achievements will serve as milestones in my learning journey.

## Tools and Technologies : 
Throughout my journey in exploring hacking and cryptography, I will be utilizing the following tools and technologies:

- TryHackMe
- CryptoHack
- Encryption and decryption techniques
- Hash functions and digital signatures
- Python 3
- Cryptographic Algorithms
- Online tools for frequency analysis and classical cryptography breaking
- Encryption and Decryption Techniques
- Hex editors for analyzing binary data.
- Wireshark
- Cryptool
- Git
- GitHub
